# what is fluffl?
fluffl is a media layer that provides an extremely simple, but cross-platform, interface between **desktop** and **wasm** targets.

## why fluffl? 
If you need a *simple* layer that provides audio,graphics, and maybe networking then this is the crate for you. 
Think of it like SDL but more primitive.
