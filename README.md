# what is g_lue?
g_lue aims to be a generic and simple front-end interface for window managament, file input, event handling, and graphcics, that intends target both desktop and wasm. 

# why g_lue? 
I basically needed a generic way to write OpenGL handle audio, events etc for both WASM and Desktop targets. Basically I wanted SDL but builable for both WASM32 and desktop, however, the sdl2-rs project explicity said they weren't supporting WASM anymore so here we are. 

# Status
The project, in its current state, is unusable. Im  working on the WASM backend currently.
